##
This tool finds unreferenced assets in Unity project.

All code combined into one script for easier portability.
So you can just copy-paste [DependenciesHunter.cs](./Packages/DependenciesHunter/Editor/DependenciesHunter.cs) to your project in any Editor folder.

# How it works

At first, it calls
```code
AssetDatabase.GetAllAssetPaths()
```
to form a map of all assets.

Then it uses:
```code
AssetDatabase.GetDependencies
```
to find dependencies for each of those assets. As a result dependencies map is formed.

Then it simply finds all assets which are not presented as a dependency within this map.
Such assets considered as unused if they aren't marked as to be ignored in this analysis (by a list of RegExp patterns).

### Addressables

To enable addressables usage uncomment the first line.

```code
// #define HUNT_ADDRESSABLES
```

# Ways of usage

The tool has two ways to use it. Each has a menu option, and an editor window.

## To list all unused assets in your project..
..click on "Tools/Dependencies Hunter" option which will open the "AllProjectAssetsReferencesWindow" window.

## To list all references towards selected assets..
..select the assets and use a context menu option "Find References in Project".
It will open the "SelectedAssetsReferencesWindow" window with the results.

| Context Menu  | Result Window |

## Settings

In the Analysis Settings foldout you can set files to be ignored by providing a list of RegExp patterns.
You can also uncheck the 'Show Unreferenced Assets Only' toggle 
to view the list of all your project assets with their references number, files sizes etc.
